    <title>Finding Maximum Consecutive Number of Binary Array</title>

</head>
<body>
    <h1> Problem 1: Find the maximum consecutive 1s in a binaryArray</h1>
    <h2> Solution: Algorithm Used</h2>
    <p>
    <ol> I initialized maxCount = 0 to store the maximum number of consecutive 1s counted. </ol> 
    <ol> I initialized currentCount = 0 to count numbers of consecutive 1s at a given instance. </ol> 
    <ol> I looped through the array: if the current element is 1, currentCount is increamented. 
        If the current count is 0, maxCount is updated with the highest count between maxCount and currentCount before currentCount is reset to 0.
    </ol>
    <ol> I updated maxCount one more time after the loop to capture maximum consecutive 1s if the longest sequence ends the array. </ol>     
    <ol> I returned maxCount to output the maximum consecutive 1s in the array. </ol>
